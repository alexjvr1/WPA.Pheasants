# Lab work for P. colchicus colchicus

The aim here is to determine the phylogenetic relationship of P.c.c. within the rest of the P.colchicus clade. 

A second aim (if we receive enough samples) is to determine the amount of genetic variation in the population. 


## Methods

We'll amplify the same markers as used by [Kayvanfar et al. 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ibi.12455)

Primers: 

1. cytb 

L14721/H16065 (Kimball et al. 1999) - these are the same as we're using for Syrmaticus


2. D-loop

L16757/H1259 (Randi 1998) - same primers as for Syrmaticus


3. HMG nucleur gene (from Kimball et al 1999)

HMG172F 

HMG172R


4. Serp (Kimball et al. 1999)

SerpinCF 

SerpinCR
